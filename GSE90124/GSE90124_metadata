!Series_summary	"Genome wide genomic DNA profiling with the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450k) of skin samples. The skin tissue DNA was derived from a peri-umbilical punch biopsy (adipose tissue was removed from the biopsy before freezing) from 322 healthy female twins of the TwinsUK cohort."
!Series_summary	"Family structure is present in this data. If the samples are related they will share a similar Relatedness identification ID either monozygotic_twinpair_* or dizygotic_twinpair_*"
!Series_overall_design	"Bisulphite converted DNA from the 322 samples were hybridised to the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip"
!Series_type	"Methylation profiling by array"
